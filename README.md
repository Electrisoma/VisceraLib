# VisceraLib

Multiproject library for general ease of development within a multiloader environment.
This library can be used in single loader projects as well for its unique APIs, but it is primarily for multiloader.

VisceraLib is meant to provide:
- Abstraction between modloader APIs.
- Implementations of Minecraft or modloader features for easier development.
- General cleanliness of code by handling things mostly in common.

## Contributing

If you feel you have something to contribute then I would be happy to accept meaningful contributions 
for the sake of furthering this project.

> _This section may receive updates with time._

## Modules

Each of these modules has some amount of documentation attached to it via a `README.md` file 
(similar to the one you're reading right now).
This is to keep things tidy and clean and to give a general concept of what's inside the module.

> _This section will have all modules and associated `README.md` files documented for reference._
